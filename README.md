# Olifant [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jaseemabid/Olifant.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jaseemabid/Olifant) [![Docker Repository on Quay](https://quay.io/repository/jaseemabid/olifant/status "Docker Repository on Quay")](https://quay.io/repository/jaseemabid/olifant)

A simple functional language targeting LLVM, __WIP__ ‚öô‚öí

Project is setup with [stack][stack]

    $ git pull https://github.com/jaseemabid/Olifant && cd Olifant
    $ stack setup && stack build

See the blog post [Lessons learned building a toy compiler][blog] for a detailed
introduction to the project.

The test coverage isn't great, but has a bunch of good code samples. They run
pretty fast üèé too.

    $ stack test

The README maybe sparse, but there is a lot of inline documentation üìú in the
code; which can be read with Haddock.

    $ stack haddock --no-haddock-deps --open

Olifant programs can be compiled to native binaries and executed in one step ‚ö°.

    $ stack exec olifant <<< 'sum 4 5'
    $ 9

This is NOT an interpreter, a machine native binary is produced and executed in
one step üé©.

    $ file /tmp/cmd.exe
    $ /tmp/cmd.exe: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64

There are some samples programs in the examples directory - these are real
programs used by the test runner so if the tests are ‚úÖ, these are guaranteed to
work.

The intermediary forms can be exported with additional flags. For example, the
output of the parser can be viewed with `-p`.

    $ stack exec olifant -- -p <<< 'sum 4 5'

```haskell
[ App (Ref
       {rname = "sum", ri = 0, rty = TInt :> (TInt :> TInt), rscope = Extern})
      [Lit (Number 4), Lit (Number 5)]
]
```

Similarly, Core is exported with `-c` and the intermediary LLVM IR is exported
with `-l`.

The compiler accepts programs from stdin or takes a file as argument.

    $ olifant -l examples/vars.ol
    $ file vars.ll
    vars.ll: ASCII text

Docker images are automatically built by quay.io as well as by Travis CI as part
of automated testing. If you have trouble building the dependencies/libraries
locally, try the container.

    $ make container
    $ docker run -it olifant/olifant

I would *LOVE* any code contributions. There is a [milestone][milestone] to
track priority bugs and features if you are looking for some inspiration.
